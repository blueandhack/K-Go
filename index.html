            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
                Go (golang) is a programming language created at Google in 2007 by
                Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.It was first announced in
                Novermber 2009.
                The purpose of creating the language is to design a systems program-
                -ming languae for large distributed system.It is now used in some of Google's
                production systems.
                There will be a new version of Go in every six months and the current
                newest version is go 1.8.1 .
                Any thing about golang can be found at https://golang.org.

        </div>

        <!-- Paradigm -->
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <h4>Paradigm</h4>
            <p>
                It is a liitle bit hard to place a specific paradigm about golang.
                Firstly, it is imperative: it has loops, statements and etc (2).
                And go is little Objected Oriented : Since it looks more like C than
                C++ and Java. For exampple, there are basic types such as int. And there is
                also object but object is just called struct in golang (1).
                Concurrent programming: Go has native support for concurrent operations.
                The concurrency in Go includes multi-threading, multi-processing, and
                asynchrony (3).

        <!-- Typing System -->
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <h4>Typing System</h4>
            <p>
                Golang is strongly typed and garbage-collected.
                Funtions are not necessarily first-class objects but golang does support
                it.
                Programmers are allowed to create new types in golang?
                Unfortunately it's not easily possible to create new types in golang since
                Go is a statically typed language and the linker will eliminate dead code.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Control Structures -->
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <h4>Control Structures</h4>
            <p>
                In golang, there is switch statements just like it in Java.
                And there is a "select" stament in golang which lets a goroutine wait on
                mutiple communication operation.
                For loop and if and else statements are slightly different with C. One
                example is below:

            <pre>
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
        if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
            return v
        } else {
            fmt.Printf("%g >= %g\n", v, lim)
        }
        // can't use v here, though
        return lim
    }


    func main() {
        sum := 0
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            sum += i
        }
        fmt.Println(sum)
    }
        </pre>

            https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/

            An interesting point about golang is there is no while loop in go
            but you can use a "for" to do a while loop.
            And yes, you have "continue" and "break" in go and they do the same
            thing here just like C.

        <!-- Support for Data Abstractions -->
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <h4>Support for Data Abstractions</h4>
            <p> As said in Typing System, it's not easy for a programmer to create a
                new abstraction (object). But the language itself does offer programmers a
                lot of abstract types.
                A list of types of golang can be found here:
                https://golang.org/pkg/go/types/
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Syntax -->
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <h4>Syntax</h4>
            <p>
                Golang's syntax is using Extended Backus-Naur Form. It seems like to
                be more mordenized than C and Java and C++.
                There is one thing about golang that I personally really hate about
                it. That is, as a C family language, the developers seem to try their best to
                make golang'syntax unlike C's. No idea why they want to do that. Maybe they
                want golang more mordenized? One example is:
                in c you do: in go you do:

                type someStruct struct{ type someStruct struct{
                int i; i int
                char j; j char
                } }
                int x =10; var i = 10
                char c='c'; var j = 'c'

                Also, '=' is the assignment operator but ':='. All those difference
                make programmers from C/C++ not that easy to get golang fast. So I would they
                can make the syntax more similar to other C family languages.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Semantics -->
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <h4>Semantics</h4>
            <p>1. scope
                Golang is lexically scoped(staticly scoped). A small example is here:

                // go run static-scope.go
                package main
                import "fmt"
                var a = 1
                func foo(){
                a = 2
                fmt.Println("in foo, a is", a)
                }

                func main(){
                var a = 0
                fmt.Println("in main, a is", a)
                foo()
                fmt.Println("after foo() call, a is", a)
                }
                /////

                And by runing this piece of golang code, you would get a result as:
                in main, a is 0
                in foo, a is 2
                after foo() call, a is 0.

                2. storage
                And how storage is allocated in golang? Well, you shouldn't really worried
                about this but a short answer here is it's a combination case of heap and stack.
                So in the current compilers, if a variable has its address taken, then that
                variable is allocated on the heap. And in some other cases, a variable can reside
                on the stack.


                3. garbage
                A big change in Go from c and c++ is the garbage collection. However, people
                would think that garbage colllection would cause the longer runtime/slower performa-
                -nce. A great example is Java. Similar to golang, java is from C and it has the automatic garbage
                collection. And we know, java is slow :(.
                However, the devolopers of Go say this:
                it's critical to eliminate that programmer overhead, and advances in garbage collection technology in
                the last few years give us confidence that we can implement it with low enough overhead and no
                significant latency.
