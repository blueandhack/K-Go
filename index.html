                        Go (golang) is a programming language created at Google in 2007 by
                        Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.It was first announced in
                        Novermber 2009.<br>
                        The purpose of creating the language is to design a systems program-
                        -ming languae for large distributed system.It is now used in some of Google's
                        production systems.<br>
                        There will be a new version of Go in every six months and the current
                        newest version is go 1.8.1 .<br>

                        It is a liitle bit hard to place a specific paradigm about golang.
                        Firstly, it is imperative: it has loops, statements and etc (2).
                        And go is little Objected Oriented : Since it looks more like C than
                        C++ and Java. For exampple, there are basic types such as int. And there is
                        also object but object is just called struct in golang (1).
                        Concurrent programming: Go has native support for concurrent operations.
                        The concurrency in Go includes multi-threading, multi-processing, and
                        asynchrony (3).

                        Golang is strongly typed and garbage-collected.<br>
                        Funtions are not necessarily first-class objects but golang does support
                        it.<br>
                        Programmers are allowed to create new types in golang?<br>
                        Unfortunately it's not easily possible to create new types in golang since
                        Go is a statically typed language and the linker will eliminate dead code.

                        In golang, there is switch statements just like it in Java.
                        And there is a "select" stament in golang which lets a goroutine wait on
                        mutiple communication operation.<br>
                        For loop and if and else statements are slightly different with C. One
                        example is below:
                    </p>

                    <pre>
package main

import "fmt"

func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
    if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
        return v
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("%g >= %g\n", v, lim)
    }
    // can't use v here, though
    return lim
}


func main() {
    sum := 0
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        sum += i
    }
    fmt.Println(sum)
}
        </pre>

                        An interesting point about golang is there is no while loop in go
                        but you can use a "for" to do a while loop.
                        And yes, you have "continue" and "break" in go and they do the same
                        thing here just like C.

                        lot of abstract types.<br>

                        Golang's syntax is using Extended Backus-Naur Form. It seems like to
                        be more mordenized than C and Java and C++.
                        There is one thing about golang that I personally really hate about
                        it. That is, as a C family language, the developers seem to try their best to
                        make golang'syntax unlike C's. No idea why they want to do that. Maybe they
                        want golang more mordenized? One example is:
                        in c you do: in go you do:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
type someStruct struct{
    int i;
    char j;
}
int x =10;
char c='c';

type someStruct struct{
    i int
    j char
}
var i = 10
var j = 'c'
            </pre>
                    <p>
                        Also, '=' is the assignment operator but ':='. All those difference
                        make programmers from C/C++ not that easy to get golang fast. So I would they
                        can make the syntax more similar to other C family languages.
                    </p>

                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h4>Semantics</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <h5>1. scope</h5>
                    <p>
                        Golang is lexically scoped(staticly scoped). A small example is here:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
// go run static-scope.go
package main
import "fmt"
var a = 1

func foo(){
    a = 2
    fmt.Println("in foo, a is", a)
}

func main(){
    var a = 0
    fmt.Println("in main, a is", a)
    foo()
    fmt.Println("after foo() call, a is", a)
}
/////
            </pre>
                    <p>
                        And by runing this piece of golang code, you would get a result as:
                        in main, a is 0
                        in foo, a is 2
                        after foo() call, a is 0.
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    <h5>2. storage</h5>
                    <p>
                        And how storage is allocated in golang? Well, you shouldn't really worried
                        about this but a short answer here is it's a combination case of heap and stack.
                        So in the current compilers, if a variable has its address taken, then that
                        variable is allocated on the heap. And in some other cases, a variable can reside
                        on the stack.
                    </p>

                    <h5>3. garbage</h5>
                    <p>
                        A big change in Go from c and c++ is the garbage collection. However, people
                        would think that garbage colllection would cause the longer runtime/slower performa-
                        -nce. A great example is Java. Similar to golang, java is from C and it has the
                        automatic garbage collection. And we know, java is slow :(.
                        However, the devolopers of Go say this:
                        it's critical to eliminate that programmer overhead, and advances in garbage
                        collection technology in the last few years give us confidence that we can implement
                        it with low enough overhead and no significant latency.

                    <h5>(i) Efficiency</h5>
                    <p>
                        One thing that golang's developers have tried to do is to make the language
                        easier for people to get. That means the golang really supports the efficency. But
                        the language itself is not that abstract so I would say golang has a similar effic-
                        -ency with Java.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>(ii) Security</h5>
                    <p>
                        Programmer get a better security/reliability in golang compare to those
                        dynamic language.
                        However, this language won't be considered to have strong security. Yes, you
                        have to handle all the errors just like in C.
                        Unlike Java, go is not run on a virtual machine. This does make the language
                        run faster but just make your programming harder.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>(iii) Extensibility</h5>
                    <p>
                        The language does support the extensibility. Like importing a package is easy.
                        By doing this, programmers can have hundred types of type from libraries. Also, golang
                        allows programmar to create their own types like what we can do in C.
                        Though go doesn't allow programmar to write the syntax and semantic.
