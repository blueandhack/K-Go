# kNN algorithm - Go Language

## What is kNN algorithm

kNN is a machine-learning algorithm used to classify each item of the testing data into a group (one of
two, in this case, because we have two training sets) based on which group has the majority of the item’s
k neighbors. For this program, we’ll let k = 3. Note that the testing data is not being added to either
training set, just classified.

## What should we know? Situation

Assume we are in a city, and the city has three police offices,
so some police man walking everywhere.
One day, the police offices need k police mans back to offices because they have a important meeting,
So, the program will help them to find k police man what is short distance to back to every office.

## How to run?

1. run generator.go to generator two csv files that include two sets points.
2. run main.go to get some results that include a map
