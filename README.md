## What is kNN algorithm

kNN is a machine-learning algorithm used to classify each item of the testing data into a group (one of
two, in this case, because we have two training sets) based on which group has the majority of the item’s
k neighbors. For this program, we’ll let k = 3. Note that the testing data is not being added to either
training set, just classified.
