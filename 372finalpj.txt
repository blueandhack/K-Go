(a) History
	Go (golang) is a programming language created at Google in 2007 by
 Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.It was first announced in 
Novermber 2009.
	The purpose of creating the language is to design a systems program-
-ming languae for large distributed system.It is now used in some of Google's
 production systems.
	There will be a new version of Go in every six months and the current
newest version is go 1.8.1 .
	Any thing about golang can be found at https://golang.org.

(b) Paradigm
	It is a liitle bit hard to place a specific paradigm about golang.
	Firstly, it is imperative: it has loops, statements and etc (2). 
	And go is little Objected Oriented : Since it looks more like C than
C++ and Java. For exampple, there are basic types such as int. And there is
also object but object is just called struct in golang (1).
	Concurrent programming: Go has native support for concurrent operations.
The concurrency in Go includes multi-threading, multi-processing, and 
asynchrony (3).

(c) Typing System
	Golang is strongly typed and garbage-collected. 
	Funtions are not necessarily first-class objects but golang does support
 it.
	Programmers are allowed to create new types in golang?
	Unfortunately it's not easily possible to create new types in golang since 
Go is a statically typed language and the linker will eliminate dead code.


(d) Control Structures
	In golang, there is switch statements just like it in Java.
	And there is a "select" stament in golang which lets a goroutine wait on 
mutiple communication operation.
	For loop and if and else statements are slightly different with C. One 
example is below:

	package main

	import "fmt"

	func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
		if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
			return v
		} else {
			fmt.Printf("%g >= %g\n", v, lim)
		}
	// can't use v here, though
		return lim
	}


	func main() {
		sum := 0
		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			sum += i
		}
		fmt.Println(sum)
	}

	An interesting point about golang is there is no while loop in go
 but you can use a "for" to do a while loop.
	And yes, you have "continue" and "break" in go and they do the same
thing here just like C.

(e) Support for data Abstractions	
	As said in Typing System, it's not easy for a programmer to create a
 new abstraction (object). But the language itself does offer programmers a
 lot of abstract types.
	A list of types of golang can be found here:

(f) Syntax

(g) semantics


(f) Syntax ¨C think about the syntax used by your language. What are the syntax choices that appeal
to you? Are there any syntactic choices that you¡¯d like to see changed (why, and to what)?
(g) Semantics ¨C briefly explain how your language is scoped (static or dynamic?), which kinds of constants
are supported, how storage is allocated (which combination of static, stack-dynamic, and/or
heap-dynamic?), and how garbage is managed.
(h) Desirable Language Characteristics ¨C In Topic 2, we covered four categories of language characteristics
that are generally thought of as ¡®desirable¡¯: (i) Efficiency, (ii) Regularity, (iii) Security/Reliability,
and (iv) Extensibility. Choose any three of these four, and discuss features of your
language that support (or limit!) them.
